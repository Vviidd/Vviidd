                    As ocean surface waves approach shore, they get taller and break, forming the foamy, bubbly surface
                    called surf. The region of breaking waves defines the surf zone, or breaker zone. After breaking in
                    the surf zone, the waves (now reduced in height) continue to move in, and they run up onto the
                    sloping front of the beach, forming an uprush of water called swash. The water then runs back again
                    as backwash. The nearshore zone where wave water comes onto the beach is the surf zone. The water in
                    the surf zone is shallow, usually between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33 ft) deep; this causes the waves to
                    be unstable.
